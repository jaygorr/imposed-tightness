In this study, you'll be shown various scenarios describing individuals engaging in different behaviors, and we'll ask you to rate how appropriate or inappropriate you find these behaviors.<br><br>There are no right or wrong answers—we're genuinely interested in your honest opinions and judgments. You'll need to make these judgments quickly, as each scenario will only be displayed for a short time. We're interested in your immediate reactions to these situations.<br><br>We'll also ask you some questions about your social attitudes and perceptions of different groups to better understand how these might relate to judgments of social behaviors.<br><br>Your responses are completely anonymous and will be used only for research purposes. The study should take about 20-25 minutes to complete. You can take breaks if needed, but we encourage you to complete the survey in one sitting if possible.</p>",

  <h3>Changing demographic condition</h3>
  <p>New U.S. Census Bureau data suggest that America will become a "majority-minority" nation much faster than once predicted. The nation's racial minority population is steadily rising, advancing an unmistakable trend that could make minorities the new American majority by midcentury. The data show a declining number of White adults and growing under-18 populations of Hispanics, Asians, and other minorities. Demographers calculate that by 2042, Americans who identify themselves as Hispanic, Black, Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander will together outnumber non-Hispanic Whites. The main reasons for the accelerating change are rapid immigration growth and significantly higher birthrates among racial and ethnic minorities. As White baby boomers age past their childbearing years, younger Hispanic parents are having children – and driving U.S. population growth. For example, there are now roughly 9 births for every 1 death among Hispanics, compared to a roughly one-to-one ratio for Whites. The latest figures are predicated on current and historical trends, which can be thrown awry by several variables, including prospective overhauls of public policy.</p>

  <h3>Control condition</h3>
  <p>New U.S. Census Bureau data suggest that the rate of geographical mobility, or the number of individuals who have moved within the past year, is increasing. The national mover rate increased from 8.4 percent in 2021 to 8.7 percent in 2022. According to the new data, 28.2 million people changed residences in the U.S. within the past year. 77.8 percent of all movers stayed within the same state. Renters were much more likely to move than homeowners. The estimates also reveal that many of the nation's fastest-growing cities are suburbs. Specifically, principal cities within metropolitan areas experienced a net loss of 1.2 million movers, while the suburbs had a net gain of .8 million movers. For those who moved to a different county or state, the reasons for moving varied considerably by the length of their move. The latest figures are predicated on current and historical trends, which can be thrown awry by several variables, including prospective overhauls of public policy.</p>
